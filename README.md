# Edge AI With FIWARE - Battery State of Health Estimation

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing different approaches for Battery State of Health (SOH) estimation using machine learning and statistical methods.

## Overview
This project explores two different methodologies for estimating battery State of Health:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

## Notebooks
**LSTM.ipynb**
- Implementation of LSTM model for SOH prediction
- Handles temporal dependencies in battery data
- Suitable for capturing long-term patterns in degradation

**ARIMA.ipynb**
- Time series forecasting using ARIMA methodology
- Statistical approach to SOH prediction
- Effective for trend and seasonality analysis

## Requirements
```python
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
statsmodels
sklearn
matplotlib
jupyter
```

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project by forking the repository, creating your own branch and submitting a pull request with your improvements. We welcome all contributions that enhance the functionality or performance of the system.
