# Edge AI With FIWARE - Battery State of Health Estimation

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing different approaches for Battery State of Health (SOH) estimation using machine learning and statistical methods.

## Project Overview

This project explores two different methodologies for estimating battery State of Health:

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

## Notebooks

**LSTM.ipynb**
- Implementation of LSTM model for SOH prediction
- Handles temporal dependencies in battery data
- Suitable for capturing long-term patterns in degradation

**ARIMA.ipynb**
- Time series forecasting using ARIMA methodology
- Statistical approach to SOH prediction
- Effective for trend and seasonality analysis

## Requirements

```python
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
statsmodels
sklearn
matplotlib
jupyter
```
